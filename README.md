OUTDATED/NO LONGER UPDATING

This was a stage where I wasn't really familiar with HTML and CSS, I honestly was just looking at opensource projects online and trying to replicate them. This was more of a learning experience for me, it is not a project I am proud of. I will be either making a new website or revamping this one. Most likely the first option, after I finish taking web development at my college.
