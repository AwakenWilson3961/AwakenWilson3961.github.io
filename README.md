# OUTDATED/NO LONGER UPDATING

I wasn't particularly comfortable with HTML and CSS at this point, so I was just looking at opensource projects online and attempting to copy them. This was more of a learning lesson for me than a project that I am pleased of. I'll either create a new website or redesign current one. After I finish my web programming course at college, I'll probably go with the first option.
